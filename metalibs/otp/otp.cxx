// This is a dummy file whose sole purpose is to give the compiler
// something to compile when making libtoontown.so in NO_DEFER mode,
// which generates an empty library that itself links with all the
// other shared libraries that make up libtoontown.

// This is the one file in this directory which is actually compiled.  It
// exists just so we can have some symbols and make the compiler happy.
